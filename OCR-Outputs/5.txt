introduction
This paper considers health sector reform and its impact

Abstract

This article considers some of the effects of health sector reform on human resources for health

(HRH) in developing countries and countries in transition by examénang the effect of fiscal reform
and the introduction of decentralisation and market mechanisms to the health sector.

Fiscal reform results in pressure to measure the staff outputs of the health sector. Financial
decentralisation often leads to hospitals becoming “corporatised™ institutions, operating with
business principles but remaining in the public sector. The introduction of market mechanisms
ofken involves the formation of an internal market within the health sector and market testing of
different functions with the private sector. This has immediate implications for the employment of
health workers in the public sector, because the public sector may reduce its workforce if services
are purchased from other sectors or may introduce more short-term and temporary employment
contracts.

Decentralisation of budgets and administrative functions can affect the health sector. often in
negative ways, by reducing resources available and confusing fines of accountability for health
workers. Governance and regulation of health care, when delivered by both public and private
providers, require new systems of regulation.

The increase in peivate sector provision has led health workers to move to the private sector. For
those remaining in the public sector, there are often worsening working conditions, a lack of
employment security and dismantling of collective bargaining agreements.

Human resource development is gradually being recognised as crucial to fueure reforms and the
formulation of health policy. New information systems at local and regional level will be needed to
collect data on human resources. New employment arrangements, strengthening organisational
cukure, training and continuing education will also be needed.
