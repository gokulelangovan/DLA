Abstract

Adjusting drug therapy to the individual, a common approach in clinical practice, has evolved from
1) dose adjustments based on clinical effects to 2) dose adjustments made in response to drug levels
and, more recently, to 3) dose adjusements based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing of
drug-metabolizing enzyme genes, suggesting a slow drug metabolism phenotype. This development
dates back to the middle of the 20% century, when several diferent drugs were administered on
the basis of individual plasma concentration measurements. Genetic control of drug metabolism
was well established by the 1960s, and pharmakokinetic-based individualized therapy was in use by

1973.

Patterns of drug prescription

Despite tremendous advances in the science and technol-
ogy of drug development, as well the emergence of guid-
ance and consensus building among scientists, many
clinicians, pharmacists, and consumers remain unin-
formed regarding the scientific basis of establishing
bioequivalence, the generic-drug approval process, and
the issues related to individualizing therapy in general
[7.8]. The consequence may be dnig dosing errors: over-
dosing or underdosing of drugs, resulting in the occur-
rence of harmful effects or the nonoccurrence of the
expected treatment benefit.

Recent information [9] indicates that doctors are not con-
sistently prescribing proven treatments at recommended
doses, and at times they are not prescribing proven treat-
ments at all. A decrease in dose may decrease the efficacy
{relative risk reduction [RRR]) of therapy and thereby
decrease the treatment's net benefit. Not prescribing an
agent will effectively nullify the potential benefit to indi-

viduals, and when repeated frequently enough, failure to
prescribe the agent will significantly decrease the benefit
to the population as a whole. Ai other times, doctors tend
to prescribe a drug mote generally than clinical wials dic-
tate. The treatment of a population with lower outcome
prevalence (OP) decreases net benefit and may lead to
harm. Overdosing may increase treatment-related harm,
and underdosing may erode efficacy; both will result in
diminished treatment benefits. Finally, noncompliance
on the part of the patient may lead to a decrease in efficacy
and a requisite decrease in net weatment benefit If a
patient reduces the dose without totally eliminating the
drug, the risk of non-dose-related side effects of treatment
may remain.

The relationship between the terms mentioned above,
which govern weatment success, can be expressed mathe-
matically as follows [10-12]:
Net Benefit = RRR * OP - Harm
