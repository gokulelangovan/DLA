Figure 2

A-F Chromosome homologues at G! in nuclei of non-cycling cells are spatially arranged without respect to non-homologues.
Same cell line and same cell harvest as the triploid cells probed in Fig 1. Twe combinations of three subtelomeric probes (see
Table | far clones) are shown hybridized to triploid cells. In fig 2A-C the nuclei are probed with three single subtelamere
probes from 4p (spectrum orange); 18q (spectrum green) and 6p (both spectrum orange and spectrum green babeis, i.e. yellow
signal). In figs 2D-F, the nuclei are probed with three subtelamere probes labelled Sp (spectrum orange), 12q (spectrum green),
and 20p (spectrum orange and spectrum green, i.e. yellow signal). Note: There was no segregation into haploids sees of chro-
mosomes at GI interphase. Homologues were regularly arranged without any defined relationship ta non-homologous signal
groups; Le. haploid sets of interphase chromosomes distributed to separate nuclear regions do not appear to exist. Note also
there is a low frequency of solated non-homologous associations: beeween 4p and 6p (Fig 2A); between 6p and |18q (Fig 2C),

and between 5p and 20p (Fig 2D).

With centromeric and painting probes, Nagele et al.
[9.10,13] detected the presence of what they believed to
be haploid sets of chromosomes in both diploid and tip-
loid cells with the sets on opposite sides of the nucleus. In
sone cell shapes (e.g, elongated, polymorphic, or lenticu-
Jar shaped cells) this regular order was obscured but in
spherical nuclei it was mostly evident. Whereas there is
often a spatial separation of the telomeric signals from the
various homologues of the diploid os tiploid C1-arrested
cells in the present data (see fig 1) there was no evidence
for a chromosome order or haploid groups in the cell
nuclei (fig 2). In the explanation of Nagele et al. [13] the

haploid sets these authors proposed represented maternal
and paternal chromosome conwibutions. In the present
data each set of identical homologues (two in diploid or
three in uiploid cells) appear to be arranged without
respect to those of other chromosomes (fig 2), i-e. the spa-
tial arrangement is not an interchromosomal phenome-
non. This means the theoretical haploid sets of
chromosomes described by Nagele et al. [9,10,13] proba-
bly do not exist. Figure 2 illustrates the two experiments
performed in the current study to address the possible
existence of haploid sets. These comprised examining the
chromosome order for the single telomeres 4p (labelled
