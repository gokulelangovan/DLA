Dances as Windows into Insect Perception

Xperimental peychologists

working with humans bave a

fundamental advantage over
scientists studying the behaviour of
other animals. This is because buman
subjects can give a verbal account
of thes experience. For example,
they can report “These two lights of
different colour look equally bright”
on “This object looks further away than
that one’. Such direct reports facilitate
studying bow information from the
sensory periphery, that is, the sense
oegans that actually interface with the
environment, ix processed in the brain.

The perceptual workd of animabs

is often very different from that of
humans, Many animals have sensosy
Gacilities that we bumans lack: for
example, insects can spe ultraviolet
and polarised light. But how they
actually perceive the world, based
on information from their sensory
periphery, is often beyond our grasp.
Because animals cannot describe their
sensations, ow acces to them is often:
based on indirect peychophysical
tests, where animal
depends fundamentally on motivation:
and training method (Chittha et al.
2003). However, some animals do in
ct describe the world around them,
bait not necesearily in ways that we
snight intuitively understand, Perhaps
the best example of this are the
honeybees (genus Apis), which lve
