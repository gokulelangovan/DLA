of thase who reported acute attacks suffered only one,
some had experienced as many as 12 attacks during the
past yeas (Table 1). The mean number of ADLA attacks
tended to rise with stage of lymphoedema.

Out patient departments (OPD) of Government hospitals
(44.9%), private practitioners (30.6%) and filariasis clin-
ics (14.3%) were the preferred sources of treatment for
acute attacks. The treatment cost of an acute attack ranged
from Rs. 100 to 3500 (1 US$ = 100 SLR) with an average
cost of Rs. 737.91 per attack for those who sought private
care (n = 48). The average duration of an acute attack was
3.5 days. Fifty two percent of those who had experienced
an acute attack in the past (n = 48) were totally incapaci-
tated (unable to attend to any domestic / economic activ-
ity) while 31.3% were moderately incapacitated (able to
attend to same domestic { econamic activity} for the dura-
tion of the acute attack.

Almost all subjects (n = 60, 92.396) believed that their
lymphoedema was reversible and treatment with antipar-
asitic drugs was identified as the most important thera-
peutic option for reversing/ halting the progression of the
disease.

Only 18.2% of the study sample felt that they were being
shunned by the society and that their altered physical
appearance elicited various reactions ranging from sym-
pathy to fear and ridicule from the community.

Non-clinic attendees

During the period of this study an atrempt was also made
to collect comparable data from non-clinic auendees.
However, it was possible to identify only 10 subjects, all
seeking treatment in the OPD of the University Teaching
Hospital. These 10 patients were in lymphoedema stages
I (n = 2), I (n = 2) and Ul (n = 6) respectively. According
to the data elicited by using the same questionnaire, 8 of
these 10 non-clinic attendees (80%) were unaware of the

Discussion

The results of this survey indicate that the majority of
patients attending filariasis clinics are aware af the impor-
lance of the currently recommended morbidity control
measures. ]t was also encouraging to note that many prac-
ticed at least some of the morbidity control measures that
they had learnt, especially washing the affected part with
soap and clean water once or twice a day. Although many
were aware of the importance of minimizing skin trauma,
a sizeable proportion used coir to clean the skin of the
affected pan during washing. This is a harmful practice
which could traumatize the skin and lead to entry lesions;
therefore demonatration of suitable alternatives is dearly
necessary. A community educational programme may be
especially beneficial as it would also involve the family
members of the affected population who are often the car-
egivers of patients affected with severe grades of tym-
phoedema. Involving the family in the care of the patient
will also help to reduce the feelings of stigma, isolation
and neglect experienced by some of the patients.

Limb elevation was identified as an important measure by
most patients but not practiced on a regular basis by
many. Poor compliance with limb elevation has also been
teported in Southern India [6]. The authors attributed this
to incanvenience and the belief that it caused only a tem-
porary reduction in lymphoedema.

Movement and elevation has been shown to play an
imponant role on the lymphatic and venous systems of
the body [7-9]. However, only 31.8% of the study
population was aware of the importance of exercise and
very few practiced it on a regular basis. Patients with lym-
phoedema tend ta become increasingly immobile and the
affected limb is most often in a dependent position caus-
